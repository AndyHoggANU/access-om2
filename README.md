ACCESS-OM
=========

The Australian Community Coupled Earth System Simulator Climate Model (ACCESS-CM) is a coupled climate model with several configurations: 

- An ocean only configuration consisting of MOM (www.mom-ocean.org), CICE (http://oceans11.lanl.gov/drupal/CICE) and a data driven atmosphere coupled together with OASIS3-MCT (https://verc.enes.org/oasis).
- A climate configuration as above but with a dynamic atmosphere component.

This repository contains the ocean only configuration, which is called ACCESS-OM.
