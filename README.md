ACCESS-OM
=========

The Australian Community Coupled Earth System Simulator - Climate Model (ACCESS-CM) is a coupled climate model with several configurations. The ocean only configuration consists of MOM (www.mom-ocean.org), CICE (http://oceans11.lanl.gov/drupal/CICE) and a data driven atmosphere coupled together with OASIS3-MCT (). The climate configuration includes a dynamic atmosphere component. This repository presently only supports the ocean only configuration, called ACCESS-OM.
