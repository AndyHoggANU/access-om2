ACCESS-OM
=========

The ACCESS-CM (Australian Community Coupled Earth System Simulator - Climate Model) is a coupled climate model. It has several configurations. The OM (Ocean Model) configuration consists of MOM (www.mom-ocean.org), CICE (http://oceans11.lanl.gov/drupal/CICE) and a data driven atmosphere. The CM (Climate Model) configuration includes a dynamic atmosphere component. This repository presently only supports the OM configuration, called ACCESS-OM.
